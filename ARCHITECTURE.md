# Devchat Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

Devchat is a collaborative development platform built using a modern microservices-inspired architecture with clear separation of concerns. The system follows a layered architecture pattern with RESTful APIs and real-time communication capabilities.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer (Controllers)

**Purpose**: Handle HTTP requests, validate input, and return appropriate responses.

**Key Components**:

- `ProjectController`: Manages project-related HTTP endpoints
- `IssueController`: Handles issue management operations
- `UserController`: User profile and account management
- `UpdateController`: Real-time update notifications

**Responsibilities**:

- Request/response handling
- Input validation using Bean Validation
- Error handling and status code management
- CORS configuration
- Authentication and authorization checks

**Example Implementation**:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/projects")
@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")
public class ProjectController {

    @PostMapping("/create")
    public ResponseEntity<ProjectDTO> createProject(@Valid @RequestBody ProjectCreateRequest request) {
        // Input validation, business logic delegation, response formatting
    }
}
```

### 2. Business Logic Layer (Services)

**Purpose**: Implement business rules, orchestrate operations, and manage transactions.

**Key Components**:

- `ProjectService`: Project business logic
- `IssueService`: Issue management logic
- `UserService`: User-related operations
- `UpdateService`: Real-time update management

**Responsibilities**:

- Business rule enforcement
- Transaction management
- Data processing and transformation
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching)
- Integration with external services

**Example Implementation**:

```java
@Service
@Transactional
public class ProjectServiceImpl implements ProjectService {

    @Override
    public ProjectDTO createProject(ProjectCreateRequest request) {
        // Business validation, entity creation, real-time updates
    }
}
```

### 3. Data Access Layer (Repositories)

**Purpose**: Abstract database operations and provide data persistence.

**Key Components**:

- `ProjectRepository`: Project data operations
- `IssueRepository`: Issue data operations
- `UserRepository`: User data operations
- `UpdateRepository`: Update tracking operations

**Responsibilities**:

- Database CRUD operations
- Query optimization
- Data mapping between entities and database
- Connection management

**Example Implementation**:

```java
@Repository
public interface ProjectRepository extends JpaRepository<Project, Long> {
    List<Project> findByStatus(String status);
    List<Project> findByCreatedById(Long userId);
    Optional<Project> findByName(String name);
}
```

## Design Patterns Implementation

### 1. Repository Pattern

**Purpose**: Abstract data access logic and provide a consistent interface.

**Implementation**:

- All repositories extend `JpaRepository<T, ID>`
- Custom query methods using Spring Data JPA naming conventions
- Separation of data access concerns from business logic

**Benefits**:

- Testability through mock repositories
- Database technology independence
- Consistent data access patterns

### 2. Service Layer Pattern

**Purpose**: Encapsulate business logic and provide transaction boundaries.

**Implementation**:

- Service interfaces define contracts
- Service implementations contain business logic
- `@Transactional` annotations manage transaction scope
- Dependency injection for loose coupling

**Benefits**:

- Business logic reusability
- Transaction management
- Separation of concerns

### 3. DTO Pattern

**Purpose**: Transfer data between layers without exposing internal entities.

**Implementation**:

- Separate DTOs for different use cases
- Mapper classes for entity-DTO conversion
- Validation annotations on DTOs
- Immutable data transfer objects

**Benefits**:

- API versioning support
- Data validation at boundaries
- Reduced coupling between layers

### 4. Factory Pattern (Mappers)

**Purpose**: Create and transform objects between different representations.

**Implementation**:

- `ProjectMapper`: Converts between Project entities and DTOs
- `RoleMapper`: Handles role-related transformations
- Static utility methods for simple conversions
- Component-based mappers for complex transformations

**Benefits**:

- Centralized object creation logic
- Consistent transformation rules
- Easy testing and maintenance

### 5. Observer Pattern (Real-time Updates)

**Purpose**: Notify multiple components about state changes.

**Implementation**:

- Frontend real-time manager subscribes to updates
- Backend publishes updates through WebSocket
- Event-driven architecture for decoupled communication
- Polling fallback for WebSocket failures

**Benefits**:

- Loose coupling between components
- Scalable notification system
- Real-time user experience

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Implementation**:

- Each class has one reason to change
- Controllers handle HTTP concerns only
- Services focus on business logic
- Repositories manage data access only

**Examples**:

- `ProjectController`: Only handles project HTTP requests
- `ProjectService`: Only manages project business logic
- `ProjectRepository`: Only handles project data operations

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Implementation**:

- Services are open for extension through interfaces
- New features added through new implementations
- Existing code remains unchanged

**Examples**:

- `ProjectService` interface allows multiple implementations
- Repository interfaces support different data sources
- Mapper interfaces enable different transformation strategies

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Implementation**:

- Service implementations are interchangeable
- Repository implementations can be substituted
- DTOs maintain consistent contracts

**Examples**:

- Any `ProjectService` implementation can replace another
- Mock repositories work with real service implementations
- DTOs maintain consistent field structures

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Implementation**:

- Specific interfaces for different concerns
- Clients depend only on methods they use
- Focused contracts for each responsibility

**Examples**:

- `ProjectService` has project-specific methods only
- `IssueService` handles issue operations separately
- Repository interfaces are entity-specific

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Implementation**:

- High-level modules depend on abstractions
- Dependency injection through Spring framework
- Interfaces define contracts between layers

**Examples**:

- Controllers depend on service interfaces
- Services depend on repository interfaces
- Spring manages dependency injection


## Real-time Communication
